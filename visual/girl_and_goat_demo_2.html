  <p>First of all the bartender not only knew how to make our favorite drink but made it perfectly (so yourself a favor and try a Paperplane) we started off with the Pan fried shishito peppers (beautiful flavor) goat empanadas (yum), roasted cauliflower (lovely), the halibut (really delicious flavor combination), lamb ribs ( insanely tender).</p>

  <p>Here's what we tried (I think - it was kind of a food coma blur/there were a couple dishes I personally didn't try): + warm marinated olives+ pan-fried shishito peppers (parmesan and spice make everything nice)+ roasted cauliflower (simple but delish)+ chickpea fritter (maybe my fave of the night?</p>
